# Misinformation Containment Simulations

This repository contains the simulation notebook developed for my MSc dissertation:  
**‚ÄúMinimizing Misinformation Spread on Social Networks‚Äù** (University of Leeds, 2025).  

The notebook implements GPU-accelerated simulations of misinformation diffusion on the **SNAP Facebook combined network**, comparing multiple containment strategies under two canonical diffusion models.

## üìò Project Overview
Misinformation propagates rapidly in social networks due to:
- **Scale-free degree distributions** (hubs drive cascades),
- **Small-world paths** (fast global reach),
- **Community modularity** (local reinforcement).

This project evaluates containment strategies under two diffusion models:
- **Independent Cascade (IC)** ‚Äì stochastic, opportunity-driven spreading  
- **Linear Threshold (LT)** ‚Äì reinforcement-driven spreading  

### Containment strategies
- **Node blocking** (degree-based / betweenness-based)  
- **Edge blocking** (betweenness-based / random baseline)  
- **Truth campaigns** (competitive diffusion with truth-priority tie-breaking)
